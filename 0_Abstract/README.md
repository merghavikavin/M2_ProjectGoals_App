# Abstract
   Hotel Management System is a web-based application that allows the hotel manager to handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various hotel bookings.The aim of this project is to build a system that will able to automate many operations in a hotel. Modern day hotels aim to create a user friendly atmosphere with the availability of concierges who remember frequent visitors and making it possible to call and make reservations. While such hotels are extremely expensive, such a service can also be provided in a cost – effective manner with the use of computers. The process begins when a customer books a room, the booking can be placed online or through an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). The system will remember client preferences and can provide options accordingly. Once the room is booked, the visitor only needs to turn up and present identification. The system will also be able to send messages to the visitor’s phone to remind them of restaurants they may have visited in the past and other options. The system can accept bookings for restaurants present in the hotel. Things – to – do around the locality can be advertised as well through messages. Every hotel has an intricate system of cleaning and replacement of room sheets, etc. The scheduling of the same can be completely managed by this system and it can also take into account guest preferences.

   I have referenced the source code for the hotel management system from  itsourcecode.com and have made the certain changes for my required abstracts in the project.
